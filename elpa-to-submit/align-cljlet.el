;;; Commentary:

;;; Description:
;;
;; This program exists because I was tired of manually aligning let
;; statements in clojure.  This program is designed to quickly and
;; easily allow let forms to be aligned.  This is my first emacs
;; lisp program and as a result if probably less than optimal.  Feel
;; free to suggest improvements or send in patches.
;;
;; This program was inspired by align-let.el although does not share
;; any of it's code.  I had considered altering align-let.el to
;; work correctly with Clojure however it was easiler to simply
;; start from scratch.
;;
;;; Changes:
;;
;; 14-Jan-2011 - Initial release
;; 23-Jan-2011 - Bug fixes and code cleanup.
;;
;;; Known limitations:
;;
;; * This program requires clojure mode to be running in order to
;;   function correctly.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;;   To use align-cljlet.el, put it in your load-path and add
;;   the following to your .emacs
;;
;;   (require 'align-cljlet)
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; To invoke simply position anywhere inside the let statement and
;; invoke:
;;
;; M-x align-cljlet
;;
;; You may wish to bound this to a specific key.
